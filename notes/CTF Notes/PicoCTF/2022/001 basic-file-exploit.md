## Challenge:
```md
The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it! Connect to the program with netcat: `$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 49698` The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/541/program-redacted.c).
```

## Process:
First step was to *wget* the file.
```bash
wget -q https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/541/program-redacted.c
```
#wget 

The instructions say to connect to the program with *netcat*.
```bash
nc saturn.picoctf.net 49698
```
#netcat #nc

After messing with the program I gave some inputs that would not not be the correct type for what was asked for.
- First input: 2
- Second input: a -- which is not a number for the data.
Doing this supplied me with the flag.
