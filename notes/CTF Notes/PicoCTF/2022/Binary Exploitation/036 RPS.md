## Challenge:
```md
Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row. Connect to the program with netcat: `$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 51420` The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/442/game-redacted.c).
```

## Process:
The *hint* recommends looking at how it checks if I won.
```c
bool play () {
  char player_turn[100];
  srand(time(0));
  int r;

  printf("Please make your selection (rock/paper/scissors):\n");
  r = tgetinput(player_turn, 100);
  // Timeout on user input
  if(r == -3)
  {
    printf("Goodbye!\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  int computer_turn = rand() % 3;
  printf("You played: %s\n", player_turn);
  printf("The computer played: %s\n", hands[computer_turn]);

  if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
    puts("You win! Play again?");
    return true;
  } else {
    puts("Seems like you didn't win this time. Play again?");
    return false;
  }
}
```
#c 

```c
  if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
```
#c #strstr 

Looking at the *strstr* manual.
```bash
man strstr
```
#man #strstr

From the *man page*.
```
The  strstr()  function  finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack.  The terminating null bytes ('\0') are
       not compared.
```
#strstr 

So we can pass all the answers per answer and always win.

And there's 5 wins!
```bash
echo "picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_58F0F41B}" > flag.txt
```
#echo 

**Flag: *picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_58F0F41B}***
