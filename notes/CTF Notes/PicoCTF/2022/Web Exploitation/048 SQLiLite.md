## Challenge:
```md
Can you login to this website?
```

This challenge launches an instance.
```md
Can you login to this website? Try to login [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:54570/).
```

## Process:
First I opened up the site and tried admin for both the user and password. Failed.

So then I used a simple ```' OR 1=1 --``` SQL injection. Success!

#SQL #SQLinjection

This SQL injection is done by using the 'admin' username and then the ```OR 1=1```, since true, returns all passwords. The ```--``` is used to comment out the rest of the query.

And then taking a look at the source.

There's our flag.
```bash
echo "picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_9b0a4e21}" > flag.txt
```
#echo 

**Flag: *picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_9b0a4e21}***
